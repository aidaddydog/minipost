Huandan domain package.

This package contains models, services and routers to integrate the
standalone `huandan.server` features into the minipost backend.

It defines database models to store order‑to‑tracking mappings and
PDF file information, business functions to interact with the data,
and FastAPI routes that expose compatible APIs for the huandan client.
