"""
API v1 entry point for minipost with huandan integration.

This module aggregates all API routers to be included in the FastAPI
application.  In addition to the existing orders and logistics routers
provided by the base project, the huandan router is imported and
included to expose the desktop client compatible endpoints.

If you add more domain routers in the future, include them here so
they are automatically registered when the application starts.
